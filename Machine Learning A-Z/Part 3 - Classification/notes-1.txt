Unlike regression where you predict a continuous number, you use 
classification to predict a category. There is a wide variety of
 classification applications from medicine to marketing. Classification
 models include linear models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and nonlinear 
ones like K-NN, Kernel SVM and Random Forests.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following 
Machine Learning Classification models:

Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Kernel SVM
Naive Bayes
Decision Tree Classification
Random Forest Classification
