Reinforcement Learning is a branch of Machine Learning, also called Online
 Learning. It is used to solve interacting problems where the data observed
 up to time t is considered to decide which action to take at time t + 1. It 
is also used for Artificial Intelligence when training machines to perform tasks
 such as walking. Desired outcomes provide the AI with reward, undesired with 
punishment. Machines learn through trial and error.

In this part, you will understand and learn how to implement the following 
Reinforcement Learning models:

Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
Thompson Sampling
