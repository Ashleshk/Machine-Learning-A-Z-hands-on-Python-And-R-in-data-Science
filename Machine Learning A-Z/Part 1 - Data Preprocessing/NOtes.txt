A class is the model of something we want to build. For example,
 if we make a house construction plan that gathers the instructions 
on how to build a house, then this construction plan is the class.

An object is an instance of the class. So if we take that same example
of the house construction plan, then an object is simply a house. A house 
(the object) that was built by following the instructions of the construction
 plan (the class).
And therefore there can be many objects of the same class, because we can
 build many houses from the construction plan.

A method is a tool we can use on the object to complete a specific action. 
So in this same example, a tool can be to open the main door of the house if
 a guest is coming. A method can also be seen as a function that is applied onto
 the object, takes some inputs (that were defined in the class) and returns some output.
